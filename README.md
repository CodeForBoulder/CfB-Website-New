# New Code For Boulder Website 

We're redesigning the old website for the Code for Boulder Brigade and modeling it after other fancy and great CFA brigade we liked. 

All issues will be posted on the Github issue tracker, so feel free to join in there!

The completed project will use Jekyll and Github Pages as well as integrations with the Meetup and Github APIs.
